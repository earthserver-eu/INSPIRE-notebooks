## About
EarthServer-2 Services (www.earthserver.eu) are based server-side on Rasdaman (www.rasdaman.com), client side on WebWorldWind.

The very same backend can be used with several possible clients other than just Web Applications, based on the OGC standards used within EarthServer-2 and backed by the robust endpoints of its multidisciplinary data services.

One of the possible analytical clients, increasingly popular in the scientific community, is Jupyter/iPython (http://jupyter.org). In this respect, the EarthServer-2 consortium started exploring new ways to combine the interactive analytical capabilities of Jupyter together with the flexible and resource-savvy WCS/WCPS approach.

Jupyter client-side, matched with rasdaman/WC(P)S server-side, offer a very powerful combination of visualisation and analysis, with easy-to use and share rich notebooks based on highly scalable server endpoints.

## Notebooks

### WCPS Planetserver
This notebook shows a few examples on how to query spectral data and how to do band math with WCPS queries
